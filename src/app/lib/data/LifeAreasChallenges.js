          "- The Architect orients toward group dynamics in friendships, often accepting invites to maintain cohesion, unlike the Engineer's self-focused selections.\n- Your outward energy makes social draining more noticeable for both, but the Engineer pulls back faster to recharge alone.\n- Harmony-driven participation can feel obligatory to the autonomous partner, leading to mismatched social calendars.\n- The Architect might see the Engineer's declines as isolating, while the Engineer views over-commitments as exhausting.\n- Over time, these differences create imbalances in your shared community involvement.",
